## About

> In general, I have great interest in software. Even though, I did not have taken the time to dive deep into all fields.

Mostly I spend my time developing web application using Django (Python), Postgres, Celery, Redis, Nginx. For some side projects I have used Next.js with React and TailwindCSS. I am big fan of Docker and use Docker Compose for all my projects.
